# Heart-Risk-Disease-Prediction
This project compares the performance of various machine learning classifiers in predicting heart disease risk. Using medical and demographic data, the goal is to evaluate models like logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to identify the most effective algorithm for accurate heart disease risk prediction.

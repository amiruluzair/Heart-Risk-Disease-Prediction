# Heart-Risk-Disease-Prediction
This project compares the performance of various machine learning classifiers in predicting heart disease risk. Using medical and demographic data, the goal is to evaluate models like logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to identify the most effective algorithm for accurate heart disease risk prediction.
Linear Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 0.739. It showed decent recall for class 1.0 (heart disease risk), but the overall performance was lower compared to other models.
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): Scored 0.889 accuracy with high precision and recall for both classes, making it a strong performer for this task.
Decision Tree: Delivered 0.935 accuracy with excellent precision and recall for both classes. It is the most consistent model, providing balanced performance for both classes.
Naive Bayes: Had the lowest accuracy at 0.709. While it performed relatively well for class 1.0, its lower recall for class 0.0 led to reduced overall accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved 0.839 accuracy with good recall for class 1.0, though slightly weaker for class 0.0 compared to KNN and Decision Tree.
